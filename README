Monitor disk information of all the ec2 instances
================================================

Gets the disk usage information of all the instances and mails the same to the
specified email address. There is an additional feature to notify when the
disk usage increases above a margin.

Run :
bundle install

Usage :
ec2 = EC2Helpers.new(70, ec2 access key, ec2 secret key, "example@ex.com")
ec2.get_disk_info_of(ec2.app_servers)

TODO:
- 1. Reading the commands to be run on an instance from redis, so that we can push the commands
     to a list and those stats will be mailed to you automagically.
- 2. Dynamic filters for a given set of instances.
